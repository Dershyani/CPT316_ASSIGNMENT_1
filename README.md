## MiniLang Compiler: A Simplified Compiler for Educational Purposes

### Description
This project implements a compiler for MiniLang, a simplified programming language designed for educational purposes. MiniLang introduces basic lexical elements, syntax rules, and error-handling mechanisms to demonstrate the core concepts of compiler design.

### Introduction
The MiniLang Compiler supports:

- Lexical Analysis: Tokenization of source code into meaningful elements (keywords, identifiers, literals, operators, etc.).
- Syntax Analysis: Creation of an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to represent the program's structure.
- Error Handling: Reporting lexical and syntax errors with detailed messages for debugging.
MiniLang is designed to help beginners understand compiler implementation, focusing on core programming concepts like variable declarations, expressions, and control flow.

### Features
Keywords: Supports **if** , **else**, **while**, **do**, and **print**.
- Statements: Assignment, If-Else, Loops, and Print statements.
- Expressions: Arithmetic and Relational expressions with operator precedence.
- Error Handling: Comprehensive feedback for lexical and syntax errors.
- Programming Paradigms: Combines procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

### Installation
- Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/MiniLang-Compiler.git
```
- Install the required dependencies (if any).

### Usage
1) Run the Jupyter Notebook in a Python environment.
2) Follow the steps to:
    - Perform Lexical Analysis.
    - Generate Syntax Trees.
    - Test with sample MiniLang code provided in the repository.


### Example
Example MiniLang Code:
a=5; b=7; c=(9+a)*b;
