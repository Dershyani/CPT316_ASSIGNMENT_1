## MiniLang Compiler: A Simplified Compiler for Educational Purposes

### Description
This project implements a compiler for MiniLang, a simplified programming language designed for educational purposes. MiniLang introduces basic lexical elements, syntax rules, and error-handling mechanisms to demonstrate the core concepts of compiler design.

### Introduction
The MiniLang Compiler supports:

- Lexical Analysis: Tokenization of source code into meaningful elements (keywords, identifiers, literals, operators, etc.).
- Syntax Analysis: Creation of an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to represent the program's structure.
- Error Handling: Reporting lexical and syntax errors with detailed messages for debugging.
MiniLang is designed to help beginners understand compiler implementation, focusing on core programming concepts like variable declarations, expressions, and control flow.

### Features
Keywords: Supports **if** , **else**, **while**, **do**, and **print**.
- Statements: Assignment, If-Else, Loops, and Print statements.
- Expressions: Arithmetic and Relational expressions with operator precedence.
- Error Handling: Comprehensive feedback for lexical and syntax errors.
- Programming Paradigms: Combines procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

### Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/username/MiniLang-Compiler.git
Install the required dependencies (if any).
